# ML-projcets-portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.


Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

# Contents
   *  [Employee Attrition Prediction using ML:](https://github.com/mounikachundru/ML-projcets-portfolio/blob/main/HR_ATTRITION_PROJECT.ipynb) In this project Random Forest Algorithm is used to predict and identify the main factors related to employees attrition.The obtained model for the prediction of employeesâ€™ attrition is tested on a dataset.
   *  [Unsupervized Machine Learning:](https://github.com/mounikachundru/ML-projcets-portfolio/blob/main/TSF%20TASK1.ipynb) Prediction of the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied by using a simple linear regression.
